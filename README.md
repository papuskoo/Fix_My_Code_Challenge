# Fix my code

>`Fix my code` is a new type of project, where we’ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!. It's going to be FUN !!.
>Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.

- Please download the repository [0x00-Fix\_My\_Code\_Challenge](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) and use it as initial files for all solutions.
- You should not recode everything, just fix it!

## About

- This repository consists of all the .Subject projects done with [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by [CtrLBugs](https://github.com/ctrlbugs/).

Project: Python Test-driven Development
This project focuses on practicing Test-driven Development (TDD) in Python. It consists of several tasks aimed at understanding the importance of writing tests before writing code and implementing solutions while meeting specific requirements and learning objectives.

Learning Objectives
Understand why Python programming is awesome
Learn about interactive tests and their importance
Practice writing Docstrings for tests and documentation for modules and functions
Explore basic option flags for creating tests
Learn to find edge cases and handle them appropriately

Tasks Overview
Integers Addition: Write a function to add two integers.
Divide a Matrix: Implement a function to divide all elements of a matrix by a number.
Say My Name: Write a function to print a person's name.
Print Square: Create a function to print a square using the '#' character.
Text Indentation: Implement a function to print text with new lines after '.', '?', and ':'.
Max Integer - Unittest: Write unit tests for a function to find the maximum integer in a list.
Matrix Multiplication: Develop a function to multiply two matrices.
Lazy Matrix Multiplication: Implement matrix multiplication using the NumPy module.
CPython #3: Python Strings: Create a function to print Python strings (C extension).
Instructions
All Python scripts should follow the specified format and guidelines.
Unit tests should be written for each function using the unittest module.
Documentation should include Docstrings for functions and modules.
Follow the provided task descriptions and requirements closely.
How to Run Tests
To run the tests for each task, use the following command format:

'''
Copy code
python3 -m doctest ./tests/<test_file_name>.txt
For running unit tests, use:

Copy code
python3 -m unittest tests.<test_file_name>
